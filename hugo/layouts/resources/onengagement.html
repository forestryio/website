      <p class="explanation">In an effort to predict return-on-ad-spend, the industry has defaulted to clicks and views—holdover metrics from a desktop-only world. Clicks certainly count, but they only tell a fraction of the buyer’s story, obscuring the reality of true intent.</p>

      <div class="headline-cap">DON'T JUST GET THE CLICK, <br>GET WHY THE CLICK HAPPENED</div>
      <p class="explanation">If you want the truth on customer preferences and campaign efficacy, you need the metrics that will help you understand. The seductive click-baits and relentless pop-ups are bred from the way it is: current incentives and short-term profits.

        <p class="explanation">Without proper measurement, we are blind to the vital intelligence that lives before the click: the considering, examining, and comparing. By tracking a full suite of metrics—the swipes, lingers, hovers, scrolls, views, plays, etc.—we now have a picture of behavioral interaction we just haven’t seen before.

        <strong>46% of brand marketers and 43% of agencies</strong>
        report that "the current metrics (clicks, viewability, etc.) used to measure performance on mobile aren’t effective."
