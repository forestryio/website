The Super Bowl may be the most watched sports event in the U.S., but we all know Super Bowl Sunday is about the ads as much as it's about the game. And if we're being honest, for the Design team at Yieldmo, the ads are the only reason we watch (okay, and maybe the buffalo chicken dip).

Regardless of who you were rooting for, we all remember that Budweiser "Whassup?" commercial that your friends couldn't stop repeating for weeks, or E-Trade's hilarious and borderline creepy "Talking Baby." That's because Super Bowl ads are some of the best—they play to our emotions or make us laugh to the point where they become ingrained into our culture.

This got us thinking... what would happen when you take some of the best creative from past Super Bowls and reimagined it in [the best formats available](https://www.yieldmo.com/resources/blog/study--66--of-consumers-want-better-designed-mobile-ad-formats--and-your-brand-should-too-/ "66% of Consumers Want Better-Designed Mobile Ad Formats")—Yieldmo's highly engaging and user-friendly mobile ad formats? The results are what you'd imagine—amazing ads that you can interact with right in the palm of your hand. Touchdown!

**Oreo: Blackout**

While this ad appeared on Twitter, not during a commercial break, its timeliness during a blackout made it an instant hit. Now, we're giving this timeless Super Bowl icon a permanent home within our Window unit, which let's you relive Oreo's creative genius time and again.

**Bai: Bai Bai Bai**

We all love an \*NSYNC throwback, but it's even better when it's delivered by Christopher Walken. And it's best in the Yieldmo Pull format, which shows you three sequential frames from this iconic commercial.
