**Yieldmo: Scroll**

When it comes to ad units, [Yieldmo](http://adexchanger.com/mobile/yieldmo-were-a-content-ad-company-its-a-new-animal/) is all about creativity. The company, which describes itself as a private mobile marketplace for premium publishers, makes all of its mobile ad units available for large scale distribution through its proprietary exchange. One such unit is the [Hyperscroller](http://adformatlaboldsite.yieldmo.com/ "Hyperscroller"), which enables users to advance through an animation as they scroll through a page on their mobile device.

“\[Yieldmo’s formats\] interact with the reader based on their place on the publisher page,” said Eric Simon, EVP and general manager at Yieldmo. “The design team at Yieldmo’s AdFormat Lab is focused on creating engaging and effective ad formats that aren’t jarring to the user experience.”
