### **“The fundamental ingenuity and creativity of great publishers and thoughtful advertising by talented creative agencies has been undermined by the fragmentation and insular ad tech industry that provides the infrastructure and ad formats for this mobile age.”**

Our Head of Design, David Goligorsky, [published this piece on Medium](http://medium.com/@dgoligorsky/better-mobile-ad-formats-can-save-the-free-web-524dbd780dc8#.kfst9mxiy) about how well-designed ad format products can empower publishers and marketers to succeed.

In an era where the revenue and experience of publishers’ owned and operated pages are threatened by ad blocking and walled-garden platforms, better mobile ad products can help keep editorial experience great and raise marketer demand for great publisher inventory. This tidal shift can only happen if Chief Marketing Officers and Chief Digital Officers demand better mobile products from their agencies and media buyers.
