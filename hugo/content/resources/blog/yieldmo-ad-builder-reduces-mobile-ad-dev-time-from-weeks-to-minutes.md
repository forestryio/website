Yieldmo (a mobile ad tech company backed by Google Ventures, Time Warner Investments, and Union Square Ventures) launched its new Ad Builder tool which will enable ad agencies and publishers to create ads designed for mobile devices in just minutes. The new tool allows public access to an ever-growing list of customizable and mobile-specific ad formats. The formats are designed by the company’s Ad Format Lab and have been optimized across Yieldmo’s wide-reaching network, which ComScore estimates to be 110M unique visitors, comparable to the reach of Google, Facebook, Amazon and Yahoo.

Yieldmo’s product designers began Ad Builder last year when they studied the difficulty advertisers’ and publishers’ sales teams had mocking mobile ads for their media plans. To simplify this process, Yieldmo built a guided, web-based tool that would make mock-ups quick and easy. Unlike complicated rich media tools that dominate the space, Yieldmo’s Ad Builder is designed to work without any training, so anyone can use it. The company expects to reduce the creative approvals process from weeks to mere hours or less.  
   
Once your ad is built, it is easily shared via a copy-and-paste URL that let’s your collaborators view live previews of the ad. Creative assets are automatically stored in Yieldmo’s system so they’re ready to run shortly after creation. Yieldmo hopes that by enabling advertisers and publishers to “speedstorm” their mobile ad ideas, they will iterate and innovate more quickly in the growing mobile ad space.
