We all know that the content that we consume via our mobile devices are often subsidized by the advertising revenue. But people hate ads…but want their content for free.  Yieldmo is working to solve this problem by creating a better ad experience through design and data. We’d love to see what people can come with given our ad building tools and inspiration from our industry-touted designs.

To help you with your ideas, we’ve provided a few links and tools:

**Yieldmo Ad Formats**

* Our [Ad Format Lab  website ](http://adformatlaboldsite.yieldmo.com/) has a list of our ad formats including some demos so you can see what they look like.  Feel free to get inspired by any of these formats.  To access the Beta formats, use the password “tucker”.
* If you want to create your own ad, you can use Yieldmo’s [Ad Builder](http://adbuilderoldsite.yieldmo.com/#/adbuilder), which is an amazingly easy to use tool that pulls in whatever creative you want to pull together.
* We’ve created a few sample ads that you can use or modify:
  * [BaubleBar](http://adbuilderoldsite.yieldmo.com/#/share/2b494a3c-78b6-4470-a0c0-821bc1ce7ff9) Postcard
  * [16 Handles](http://adbuilderoldsite.yieldmo.com/#/share/1a946da4-9599-4274-b517-bd16950de30b) Mainstage
  * [RedBull](http://adbuilderoldsite.yieldmo.com/#/share/93669502-fd96-4472-aac1-90a20777bb3e) Window
  * [Normal Headphones](http://adbuilderoldsite.yieldmo.com/#/share/8536de1a-9105-45f3-9e29-bbe42d75a9a8) Pull
  * [Kitchensurfing](http://adbuilderoldsite.yieldmo.com/#/share/a6e571e9-67a9-4e38-9646-4d6760d91a9a) Video
  * You can also modify a [sample page](http://adformatlaboldsite.yieldmo.com/mocks/hackathon_demo/) that displays these ads in rotation.

 

**Yieldmo Data**

* For those that are looking to do some fun with data and data visualization, we have a mySQL database for you to access.

`Hostname: hackathon-mysqloldsite.yieldmo.com`

`Port: 3306`

`Schema: hackathon`

`username: ym_hacker`

`password: hackmobile2015`

This user has select-only privileges to the schema and can only be accessed within our network.  See us if you want to do something more with the schema.

Table Schema Definitions:

**Yieldmo Placements**

* If you want to play with our actual ad placement, we’ve created a [demo page](http://adformatlaboldsite.yieldmo.com/mocks/hackathon_demo/) to show you how you can insert our placements, which can show a variety of ads.
* We also have more detailed [documentation](http://s3.amazonaws.com/staticoldsite.yieldmo.com/icons/beta/PublisherYieldmoIntegrationGuide-MobileWeb.pdf) if you’d like to integrate our ad code on your own webpage, or feel free to integrate our mobile SDK’s into your own app
