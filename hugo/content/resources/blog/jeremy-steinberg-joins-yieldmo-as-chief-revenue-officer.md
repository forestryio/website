Yieldmo, the leader in engagement-powered mobile advertising, has appointed Jeremy Steinberg as Chief Revenue Officer. Steinberg most recently led the advertising division of The Weather Company and played an important role in their acquisition by IBM in 2015.

In the newly created position at Yieldmo, Steinberg will leverage more than 15 years of experience with data-driven advertising products to bring its new platform to market. He will also continue to grow Yieldmo’s existing managed and programmatic businesses. At The Weather Company, a business known for its trove of localized weather data, Steinberg led global sales. While there, he was responsible for bringing industry-leading solutions to market, such as the groundbreaking WeatherFX platform, and Watson Ads, the world’s first cognitive ad solution. Previously, Steinberg oversaw digital ad sales and business development at Fox News. He has also served on the Board of Directors for the IAB and the MMA (North America).

“Our user-preferred formats yield a tremendous amount of true engagement data that, today, we employ to improve clients’ performance,” said Mike Yavonditte, Yieldmo Founder and CEO. “Jeremy will continue to build on that thriving business, while expanding our presence throughout the marketing ecosystem by way of our soon-to-be-launched data platform.”

Steinberg added, “Yieldmo is known for their innovative mobile ad formats, but when I saw the scale and power of the engagement data their formats generate, I was blown away. In addition to the current ability to deliver greater efficacy and return-on-spend for clients, we have the potential to give all marketers access to the holy grail: that is, the truth about consumer interest and intent. I’m thrilled to join the Yieldmo team to help bring this vision to life.”

Effective immediately, Steinberg will be based out of the company’s New York headquarters and will report directly to Yavonditte.
