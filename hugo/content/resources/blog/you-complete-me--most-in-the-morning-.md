Is late night where all the (video) action is? We tackled this question head-on and analyzed more than 12M outstream video impressions from our [Hyperplay](http://formatsoldsite.yieldmo.com/#/demo/hyperplay) and [Windowplay](http://formatsoldsite.yieldmo.com/#/demo/windowplay) mobile formats. It turns out that your customers actually have a considerable preference for completing outstream videos when they are fresh and alert first thing in the early morning.

What does that mean for you, mobile video marketer? Make sure you day-part your video ads accordingly!
