Yieldmo will respond to properly submitted notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law. In the event that a person or entity has a good faith belief that its content is being displayed on or through the Yieldmo Service in a manner that constitutes copyright infringement (such person or entity, a "**Complainant**") and sends to Yieldmo a properly submitted copyright notice as indicated below, Yieldmo will investigate, and if it determines, in its discretion, that the material is infringing, Yieldmo will remove the content and may terminate the access of the user or customer who posted such Content to the Service in the case of repeat infringers.

All notices claiming an infringement of copyright rights must contain the following:

\(ii) A statement specifically identifying the location of the infringing material, with enough detail that Yieldmo may find it on the Service. Please note: it is not sufficient to merely provide a top level URL.

\(iii) The complete name, address, telephone number and e-mail address of Complainant.

\(iv) A statement stating that Complainant has a good faith belief that the use of the material is not authorized by the owner of the rights, their agents, or by law.
