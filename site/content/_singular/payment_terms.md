Agency agrees to pay Media Company for all charges to Agency's account for any campaign which Agency commences through the User Interface and/or via any applicable IO, in accordance with this Agreement and with any Payment Plan selected by Agency as described below. Agency agrees to: (i) promptly update all information to keep Agency's account and Payment Account (defined below) current, complete and accurate (such as a change in billing address or e-mail), (ii) promptly notify Media Company in writing if Agency becomes aware of a potential breach of security, such as the unauthorized disclosure or use of Agency's user name or password, and (iii) to comply with the agreements between Agency and the financial institution providing the Payment Account.

Note: Consistent with the convention used in the Yieldmo Terms & Conditions of which these Credit Card Payment Terms are a part, if an Advertiser is accepting the terms of this Agreement with no Agency representation, all references in this Agreement, including those in the Standard Terms, to "**Agency**" will be deemed to mean "**Advertiser**".

Note: Regardless of which Payment Plan is selected, unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties via a written IO or other agreement, Agency may immediately suspend or cancel any Payment Plan or campaign via the User Interface, and may immediately terminate this Agreement upon written notice to Media Company (email sufficing), as further described in the Yieldmo Terms & Conditions. If Agency has pre-paid for a campaign on a non-guaranteed basis and subsequently cancels such campaign while it has a remaining net prepaid balance in its account, Agency may notify Media Company via email at billing@yieldmo.com (or via the User Interface, if such option is made available), and Media Company will issue a refund back to Agency for such amount within ten (10) business days of Media Company's receipt of such notice, as further described in the Yieldmo Terms & Conditions.

There is a $50 fee for invalid chargebacks. Media Company requests that Agency discuss any disputed items directly with Media Company's account management team first to determine if a refund will be issued directly from Media Company.

###### **PAYMENT PLANS.**

\(a) GENERAL TERMS.

From time to time, one or more of the following payment plans (each, a "Payment Plan") may be available via the User Interface. If Agency enrolls in a Payment Plan, Agency is bound by the terms set forth below regarding such Payment Plan. Charges will be posted to Agency's account and must be paid pursuant to the terms of the selected Payment Plan before any of the Ads will be made available on the Sites. Agency authorizes Media Company to charge Agency's credit card, charge card, debit card or financial institution account entered by Agency in the User Interface (the "**Payment Account**") for all charges to the Agency account. Agency's spend will be decremented from the available credit in its account, and Agency will have the option to select the Payment Plan it deems most suited to its needs. Auto-Replenish and Periodic Payment Plans are self-renewing unless or until Agency participation in such Payment Plan is terminated by Agency or Media Company. Agency's non-termination or continued use of the Service reaffirms that Media Company is authorized to charge the Payment Account automatically, and Agency will be responsible for such charges. Unless Agency discontinues its enrollment in the selected Payment Plan, Agency understands that this preauthorization is valid until the termination of the Agreement with Media Company or the discontinuation of, or Agency participation in, this Payment Plan as determined by Media Company. Media Company will send Agency a notification to the e-mail address associated with Agency account after each such preauthorized transaction to notify Agency that the Agency account has been replenished and the Payment Account has been charged.

\(b) NON-RENEWING PAYMENT PLAN.

Under the Non-Renewing Payment Plan, Agency preauthorizes Media Company to charge the Payment Account on a non-recurring basis, for a specific amount specified by Agency from time to time in the User Interface. The Ads will stop being displayed upon exhaustion of such funds, and Agency must log in to its account and replenish its account in order to resume advertising.

\(c) AUTO-REPLENISH PAYMENT PLAN.

Under the Auto-Replenish Payment Plan, Agency preauthorizes Media Company to charge the Payment Account periodically on a recurring basis for a replenish amount specified by Agency in the User Interface or other applicable IO. Media Company will make commercially reasonable efforts to automatically replenish Agency's account by charging Payment Account for such replenish amount within two (2) days of projected fund depletion, as determined by Media Company in its sole discretion. Such replenish amount will be credited to Agency's account and, after first deducting any amounts that Agency may have incurred for charges, the net balance will be available to pay for future charges. Thus, while the amount charged to the Payment Account will remain the same as the initial replenish amount (unless Agency selects a different replenish amount), the amount actually available in Agency's account to pay for future charges will vary depending upon the charges Agency has incurred.

\(d) PERIODIC PAYMENT PLAN.

Under the Periodic Payment Plan, Agency will determine a monthly maximum amount in the User Interface for charges to Agency's account, subject to the terms below. When Agency enrolls in the Periodic Payment Plan, Agency preauthorizes Media Company to charge the Payment Account periodically each month up to the maximum amount that Agency specifies. The Ads will stop being displayed upon exhaustion of such funds, and will not resume being displayed until the next time that a periodic payment is automatically made to the Payment Account.

\(e) PRE-AUTHORIZED MONTHLY PAYMENT PLAN.

Subject to the terms below and subject at all times to credit approval by Media Company, when Agency enrolls in the Pre-Authorized Monthly Payment Plan, Agency preauthorizes Media Company to charge the Payment Account for the Ads that were displayed in each calendar month by the 10th day of the next calendar month, up to the maximum amount that Agency specifies. For example, for Ads that ran in April, the Payment Account will be charged by May 10th. This Payment Plan will automatically renew, and Ads will continue to be displayed, until such time as Agency selects a different monthly maximum amount or terminates its campaign as permitted by the Yieldmo Terms and Conditions.

\(f) APPROVE-UPON-INVOICE PAYMENT PLAN.

Subject to the terms below and subject at all times to credit approval by Media Company, when Agency enrolls in the Approve-Upon-Invoice Payment Plan, Agency will be invoiced for the Ads that ran in each calendar month by the 10th day of the following calendar month, and will pay such invoice upon receipt using its Payment Account or by check. Such payment can be made electronically through the User Interface, or in response to Media Company sending Agency a request for payment from the card service or from PayPal. This Payment Plan will automatically renew, and Ads will continue to be displayed, until such time as Agency selects a different Payment Plan or terminates its campaign as permitted by the Yieldmo Terms and Conditions.
